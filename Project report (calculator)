Project Report: Basic Calculator Program

1. Project Overview
   Title: Basic Calculator Program
   Language: Python
   Purpose: To create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

2. Features
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - User input for operation selection and number input
   - Continuous operation until user chooses to exit
   - Error handling for division by zero

3. Implementation Details
   3.1 Functions:
       - add(x, y): Performs addition
       - subtract(x, y): Performs subtraction
       - multiply(x, y): Performs multiplication
       - divide(x, y): Performs division with error handling for division by zero

   3.2 Main Program:
       - Utilizes a while loop for continuous operation
       - Presents a menu for operation selection
       - Takes user input for operation choice and two numbers
       - Calls appropriate function based on user choice
       - Displays the result of the operation

4. User Interface
   - Console-based interface
   - Clear menu options for operation selection
   - Prompts for number inputs
   - Displays results after each operation

5. Error Handling
   - Checks for invalid menu selections
   - Handles division by zero error

6. Future Enhancements
   - Implement more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., exponents, square roots)
   - Add memory function to store previous results
   - Develop a graphical user interface (GUI)
   - Implement floating-point precision control

7. Conclusion
   This basic calculator program successfully implements the four fundamental arithmetic operations. It provides a simple, user-friendly interface for performing calculations. The program structure allows for easy expansion and addition of new features in the future.
